# Recetario Personal (Personal Recipe Book)
This is a project that aims to solve a simple but common problem. **Do I have enough ingredients to make these recipes?**

The idea of the server is to create a simple to use web app that allows you to write down your everyday recipies, create a menu from those recipes and finally get a shopping list to realize that menu.

## The Technology And Resources Used
For this project I am using the following:
* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
* [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) *(as the database for storage)*
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Feather](https://feathericons.com/) *(For Icons)*


Right now it is still a work in progress as of now. I will be updating everything as I go along
